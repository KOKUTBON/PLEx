# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add versioned `.plex/security.yml` source, SQL sanitizer and SQL sink catalogs,
  with strict preflight validation, `--policy` override and report digests.

- Add the experimental Python `xbnd.sql-injection` rule and bundled xBOUNDARY
  provider, with static data-flow evidence and `plex security verify`.
- Export shared findings in SARIF with code flows, real rule IDs, fingerprints
  and incomplete-engine status; retain JSON v8 evidence and v7 rejection.
- Add a labeled 20-case security corpus and reproducible measurement script.

- Add lazy provider discovery and explicit plugin registration, plus
  `plex providers list|preflight|doctor` with text/JSON diagnostics.
- Fix provider compatibility snapshots on Python 3.10–3.12 while retaining
  checks of function identity derivation.

- Introduce the provider SPI and sequential orchestrator; extract the native
  performance pipeline and preserve successful-scan output and gate behavior.
- Record known incomplete analysis and rule/plugin failures as partial scans,
  preserve v8 results, and return a nonzero CLI status.
- Add schema v8 JSON reports with shared findings, evidence and engine execution
  records; mirror performance results without changing legacy statistics/gates.
- Support v7 JSON reading and lossless export with `--legacy-schema 7`; add
  `plex report --format json` conversion and explicit rejection of lossy exports.
- Publish v7/v8 schemas and [migration guidance](docs/REPORT_SCHEMA.md).

- Initial open-source distribution of PLEx, including source code, automated checks, installation documentation and community policies.

Future releases will document user-visible changes and migration requirements here.
