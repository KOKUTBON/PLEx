# Support Policy

PLEx is maintained by a single maintainer and support is best-effort.

## Supported Python Versions

PLEx supports:
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11
- Python 3.12
- Python 3.13

We follow CPython end-of-life dates and drop a Python version in the first
MAJOR release after it reaches upstream EOL. A deprecation notice is added
at least one MINOR release in advance.

## Platforms

PLEx is tested on Linux in CI. macOS and Windows are supported on a
best-effort basis for static analysis and report generation.

Dynamic verification executes user code and is recommended for trusted Linux
CI runners only.

## Getting Help

- For bugs or questions, open an issue with a minimal repro.
- For feature requests, describe the use case and expected behavior.
- For security issues, follow `SECURITY.md`.

No response-time SLA is guaranteed.
